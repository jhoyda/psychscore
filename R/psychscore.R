#' A package for reverse scoring and analyzing psychometric tests
#'
#' The psychscore package was developed for the Mar Lab at York University
#' to streamline the process of reverse scoring psychometric tests.  It
#' includes an interactive function for quickly reverse scoring and performing 
#' statistical analyses on any scales and subscales.  It is designed for researchers
#' who need to document their analysis in a script file that can be easily shared.
#'
#' The \code{\link{revScore}} function is an interactive function around which this 
#' package is based.  When it is called, it asks the user about the scale and 
#' subscales they wish to score, as well as which items are to be reverse scored.
#' It then outputs all the required code to the console window, which can then
#' be copied to a script file.
